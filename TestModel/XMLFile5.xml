  <paragraph pid="0" weight="1">The Scary Movies were good (up until 3), but because they didn&amp;#39;t justpaste a reference to The Poltergeist in the middle of a completelyirrelevant scene. They actually made jokes about it, too.</paragraph>
  <paragraph pid="0" weight="1">I&amp;#39;m pretty sure these movies have a budget of about $100, consideringthey are made very year, and Meet the Spartans had about two sets. So,they will probably keep getting made, because I&amp;#39;m sure it grosses about$1,000.</paragraph>
  <paragraph pid="0" weight="1">Here&amp;#39;s hoping this is the last one, and maybe this one will get intothe Bottom 250. (Please?)</paragraph>
